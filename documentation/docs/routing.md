Routing is automatically handled by the Next.js. By default, Next.js will serve each file in ```/pages``` with a pathname matching the filename. Subfolders with index files under ```/pages``` directory are also supported and it's the preferred method in the boilerplate.

```
pages/index.ts
pages/home/index.tsx
pages/about/index.tsx
```


*According to the above directory structure, file and folder names are defined as routes.*

```sh
pages/index -> /
pages/about -> /about
pages/home  -> /home
```


You may add custom routings to your app by using the ```app/routes.js```
